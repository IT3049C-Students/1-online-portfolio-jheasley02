## Self-Reflection: This lab was a struggle and instructions were not the clearest for me never using this program form and haven't done programming for a while so it was very difficult for me to get to it. I kept getting one Test Suite failed and the other passed, then I had 11 passed Test but kept getting two failed so I didn't know what to do.


### How long it took me to finish this?
It has taken me probably almost over two hours to work on this and finish it because I feel totally lost
